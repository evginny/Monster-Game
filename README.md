# Monster-Game
A console-based application in the spirit of the original Pokémon that is written in C++.
It is the group effort with two of my classmates AJ Tello and Nicholas Peña. <br />
The game provides an ASCII-based map that players can navigate. A random number of items (coins and potions) and monsters are generated and randomly placed on the map. Monsters’ characteristics such as size and type are randomly generated as well. The game is concluded when all monsters are defeated, and all items are collected.
